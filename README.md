# SFML-RPG
 A 2D RPG game made using C++ and SFML(Library).
A 2D game where a user is allowed to use interface like any modern games. This game was made using sophisticated libraries like SFML for audio and graphics.
This game is still in development so there is still not much to discuss on it, I will keep working on it and will soon update about it, while you can enjoy the screenshots of current game progress. To run the game simply execute the SFML-RPG.exe in Debug folder.
